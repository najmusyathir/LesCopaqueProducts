            <h1>About LC Merchandising</h1>
            <p>
                Established in 2007, LC Merchandising Sdn. Bhd. (LCM) was created as a spin-off from Les’ Copaque
                Production Sdn. Bhd. (LCP), the company behind the popular 3D animated series “Upin & Ipin.” LCM is
                responsible for
                producing and managing licensed merchandise approved by LCP. They oversee the manufacturing and
                distribution
                of a diverse range of original “Upin & Ipin” products, as well as create items based on other LCP
                intellectual properties like “Geng: Pengembaraan Bermula,” “Pada Zaman Dahulu,” “Puteri,” and
                “DaDuDiDo.”
            </p>
            <p>
                LCM offers a broad selection of products, including stationery, apparel, bags, and toys, with over 100
                options. These items are available at the Upin & Ipin Store, as well as through various stockists and
                distributors across Malaysia and in different shopping malls. The company's mission is to connect fans
                with
                LCP's characters through the sale of their merchandise, while their vision is to establish themselves as
                a
                world-class company, standing alongside international brands in the market.
